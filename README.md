# The-Longest-Common-Subsequence


You have given two sequences of integers, A = [a[1], ... , a[n]] and B = [b[1],....,b[m]], find the longest common subsequence and print it as a line of space-separated integers. If there are multiple common subsequences with the same maximum length, print any one of them.
